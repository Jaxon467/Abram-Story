Abram faced challenges, including famine and the threat of his wife being taken by Pharaoh in Egypt. He also struggled with doubt and fear, as evidenced by his request that Sarai pretend to be his sister in Egypt. Despite these challenges, Abraham demonstrated faith by obeying God's call and persevering through difficult circumstances. </h1>
